cinescript
==========

The tools *script* and *scriptreplay* allow to capture and replay the output on a terminal.
And *cinescript* replays your recordings

* embedded in your webpage,

* hosted on your own server (as static files).

See the [example](http://arnehilmann.github.io/cinescript/index.html) website...


Based on [term.js](https://github.com/chjj/term.js), inspired
by [scriptreplay](https://mister-muffin.de/scriptreplay/) and
[asciinema](https://github.com/sickill/asciinema.org)
